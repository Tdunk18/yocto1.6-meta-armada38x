meta-armada38x Getting Started Guide

BSP layer supporting Armada 38x machines, including "388-db-gp" and "clearfog"


I. System Requirements
----------------------------------

We recommend building on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  For a full list of
supported distributions, consult the Yocto manual at:
http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/1.6.2/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#detailed-supported-distros

If you are using a supported Ubuntu or Debian distribution, the necessary
support packages are shown in the following command:
  $ sudo apt-get install gawk curl wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath libsdl1.2-dev xterm


II. download_bsp.sh
----------------------------------
If this is your first time using Git on your host, configure your Git identity:
  $ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"

To initialize the BSP and syncronize with GitHub:
  $ sudo apt-get install curl
  $ curl -L http://goo.gl/orkGm1 > download_bsp.sh
  $ chmod a+x download_bsp.sh
  $ ./download_bsp.sh

This script will install repo to ~/bin, then synchronize with the source
repositories. The BSP will be installed to $HOME/armada38x-bsp by default.

NOTE: You can run '~/bin/repo sync' again in this directory to pull any
additional changes from upstream at any time.


III. Builds
==========
Use the setup-environment script to set up a new build environment.
The following example creates the build directory, configured for the
Armada 388 DB-GP machine. It will automatically place you in the build
directory after completing.

NOTE: setup-environment is sourced with the dot command '.', not run directly.

  $ cd $HOME/armada38x-bsp
  $ MACHINE=388-db-gp . setup-environment build/

Start running a build.

  $ bitbake core-image-base


IV. Write Image
===========

To write a built image to an SD card, USB key, or SATA drive, use write_image.

388-db-gp machine:
  $ sudo ./write_image build/tmp/deploy/images/388-db-gp/core-image-base-388-db-gp.tar.bz2

clearfog machine (includes u-boot.mmc):
  $ sudo ./write_image build/tmp/deploy/images/clearfog/core-image-base-clearfog.tar.bz2 build/tmp/deploy/images/clearfog/u-boot.mmc
